            <br>
            <h4><Strong>Schnitzel & Kartoffelpuffer Ingredients:</Strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 Boneless Pork Chops</li>
                    <li>3 Farm-fresh Eggs</li>
                    <li>2-3 Large Potatoes</li>
                    <li>1 White or Yellow Onion</li>
                    <li>2/3 Cup Flour</li>
                    <li>2/3 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
                    <li>1 Jar of Applesauce</li>
                    <li>5 Tbsp Cooking Oil</li>
                    <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                    <li>Lemon Wheel & Parsley (optional)</li>
                    <li>Cheesecloth (optional, paper towels otherwise)</li>
                </ul>
            <h4><Strong>Kartoffelpuffer Steps:</Strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shred all of your potatoes with a medium cheese grater. Gather small chunks of potatoes in cheesecloth and squeeze to strain water out. Afterward, lay out on paper towels and pat dry. This is <strong>very important!</strong> Any moisture in the potatoes will cause your potato pancakes to fall apart in the pan!</li>
                    <li>Place your flour and beaten eggs into 2 separate bowls. Add salt/pepper (to taste) to flour.</li>
                    <li>Heat pan to medium-high heat. Add oil and bring to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Hand-form flat, palm-sized potato pancakes and carefully place in the oil to fry.</li>
                    <li>Fry until golden-brown, flip, repeat, and remove to a cooling rack or paper towel. </li>
                    <li>Move on to Schnitzel.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4><Strong>Schnitzel Steps:</Strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>First up, grab the meat tenderizer and beat these pork chops within an inch of their lives. Be careful not to tear the meat, but these should be about 1/8-1/4 inch thick when you finish. Cover with plastic wrap to make this a cleaner job.</li>
                    <li>Add your breadcrumbs to a shallow bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add your  pan and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Dip your freshly pummelled pork chops in the flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs, and toss into the frying pan.</li>
                    <li>Fry the pork for about 3-4 minutes, or an internal temperature of 145Â°.</li>
                    <li>Set schnitzel aside, preferable on a paper towel, cooling rack, or oven rack to prevent them from getting soggy.</li>
                    <li>Plate and serve hot alongside your Kartoffelpuffer, a small cup of Applesauce, and of course, Bier!</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
