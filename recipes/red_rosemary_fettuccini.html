                    <li>Add your tomato and alfredo sauce to a small pot and set to medium heat. Mix thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Add your rosemary stalk whole and bring your sauce mixture up to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Once at a boil, remove your pot from heat and gently scoop out your rosemary stalk and any leaves it left behind. Discard.</li>
                    <li>Pour the sauce over a perfectly-made bed of fettuccine and enjoy with your favorite glass of red wine.</li>
                    <li>You could further spice up this recipe by adding chicken, etc, but this is the original recipe I made for my wife on our first date while in college and for history's sake, we're keeping it OG &#128526;</li>
