            <h4><Strong>Ingredients:</Strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Boneless Chicken Thighs</li>
                    <li>2 Farm-fresh Eggs</li>
                    <li>8 Cloves of Garlic</li>
                    <li>5 Thai Chilies</li>
                    <li>2 Cups Jasmine Rice</li>
                    <li>2 Handfuls of Thai Holy Basil</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp Oil for Frying</li>
                    <li>2 Tsp of Oyster Sauce</li>
                    <li>1 Tsp of Soy Sauce</li>
                    <li>1 Tsp of Sugar</li>
                </ul>
            <h4><Strong>Steps:</Strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start cooking your Jasmine Rice. To ensure all the food is done around the same time, wait ~20 minutes before staring step #2.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tbsp of oil to your wok/pan and bring to high heat.</li>
                    <li>Flash-fry your eggs. Set aside on a paper towel or oven rack.</li>
                    <li>Cut your chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Rinse, peel, & mince your garlic / chilies and combine in one bowl. Mix your oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar in another small bowl. Pluck your thai basil leave from the stems and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Still on high-heat, add the rest of your oil (1 tbsp) to your wok/pan.</li>
                    <li>Add in your chilies & garlic, stir-frying for 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add in chicken. Ensure fully cooked to 165°.</li>
                    <li>Once chicken is at least 165°, add your sauce & sugar and mix for another 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, toss in your basil. It is <strong>very important</strong> that you wait until the chicken is fully cooked to add the basil. You want to cook here for 5-15 seconds, enough to make the basil soft and shrunk down, being careful not to over-wilt or burn it.</li>
                    <li>Once your basil has "cooked-in" perfectly, immediately remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Serve your Thai Basil Chicken over a bed of Jasmine Rice, topped with one (or more!) of your flash-fried bubble eggs.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
